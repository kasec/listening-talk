## Communication Skills

I’m pretty sure we have listened about communication as a skill, communication is important in our day to day, but there’s a misconception.

Communication is not a skill not only one unless, to be good at communication we need a set of skills,
Can we guess which are they?

[pause 3 seconds]

Likely you can answer this question, is pretty easy, to be honest.

Speaking, Writing, Reading, and Listening.

Now, the question is, can you guess which one is the most important?

[pause 3 seconds]

You also can answer it, you could say speaking or writing, and both could be correct based on different arguments. You can say speaking is the way to connect with others or express/share your ideas, also you can say writing is too important because you need to drop first your ideas and also you can express or share them.

But what if I say the most important one is listening.

[pause 3 seconds]

Maybe at this moment, you are wondering yourself, this guy is crazy or ok tell me why?

The earliest language of communication skill learned is listening, when we are born we cannot do anything but cry and eat. 
Let's say these are basic needs.
We are raised and the first income we receive is words and a lot of words

And what does every child do with it?

We try to concentrate and process these words that the speaker is throwing at us, this sophisticated mental process that demands energy and discipline is called listening.

Some recommendations:

Give your full attention, avoid or eliminate distractions, and turn off your phone if necessary
Resist the temptation to interrupt.
Aks for more details
Offer feedback when appropriate

The advantage to listen first gives you time to think about what you are going to say, besides the speaker giving you details, we are more able to choose our responses rather than react automatically, responding to what is real, rather than emotions and misconceptions.
